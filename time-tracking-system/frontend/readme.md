# ⏱️ Time Tracking System (Frontend)

A modern **Time Tracking System frontend** built using **React + Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to help users track working time, analyze productivity, and visualize performance through dashboards and charts.

This project is being developed as part of an **internship under CodeXConquer**, where the frontend and backend are developed independently and later integrated.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Time Tracking System** allows users to:

* Track time with **second-level accuracy**
* Start, pause, stop, and reset timers
* View productivity insights using **dashboard cards and charts**
* Persist session data using **localStorage** (temporary frontend solution)

> ⚠️ **Note**
> This repository currently contains **frontend-only implementation**.
> Backend (Java-based) is being developed separately by another team member and will be integrated later.
